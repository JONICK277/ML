# ML Team B - Predicting Laid-Up Time of Vehicles

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the **laid-up time (LAID_UP_TIME)** of vehicles at dealerships using machine learning techniques. The solution involves data preprocessing, model development in Python (via Jupyter Notebooks), and detailed documentation written in LaTeX. The documentation is intended for the IntelliJ IDEA, which facilitates version control and collaboration.

### Objectives
1. Predict the expected laid-up time for vehicles at dealerships.
2. Identify key factors influencing laid-up time.
3. Recommend optimal vehicle specifications for reduced dealership duration.
